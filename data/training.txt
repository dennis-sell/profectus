such, ABL
a, AT
hot, JJ
one, CD
?, .
?, .
The, AT
answer, NN
is, BEZ
that, CS
it, PPS
was, BEDZ
a, AT
combination, NN
of, IN
circumstances, NNS
., .
First, RB
,, ,
the, AT

., .
Second, RB
,, ,
the, AT
``, ``
potato, NN
chip, NN

'', ''
has, HVZ
caught, VBN
the, AT
fancy, NN
of, IN

Both, ABX

both, ABX
were, BED

and, CC
everyone, PN

it, PPO
expected, VBD
the, AT

to, TO
have, HV
a, AT
fast, JJ
run-up, NN
., .
And, CC
third, RB
,, ,
the, AT
potato, NN
chip, NN
industry, NN
has, HVZ
taken, VBN
on, RP
the, AT
flavor, NN
of, IN
a, AT
``, ``

in, IN

The, AT

these, DTS

a, AT

of, IN

also, RB
because, RB

a, AT

of, IN

that, WPS

by, IN

The, AT
history, NN
of, IN
the, AT

is, BEZ
that, CS
many, AP

that, WPS

those, DTS

by, IN

to, TO
last, VB
almost, RB
30, CD
years, NNS
in, IN
the, AT

of, IN
the, AT

But, CC
today, NR
many, AP
of, IN
those, DTS
men, NNS
are, BER
reaching, VBG
retirement, NN
age, NN
and, CC
suddenly, RB
realizing, VBG
that, CS
they, PPSS

an, AT

with, IN
their, PP$
closely, RB

also, RB
that, CS
they, PPSS
have, HV
no, AT
second-echelon, NN
management, NN
in, IN
their, PP$

., .
So, CS
they, PPSS
go, VB
looking, VBG
for, IN

with, IN
other, AP
firms, NNS
that, WPS

publicly, RB

,, ,
and, CC
almost, RB
daily, RB
they, PPSS

All, ABN

The, AT

By, IN

we, PPSS

That, DT

The, AT
