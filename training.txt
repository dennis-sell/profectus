Last AP

there EX

But CC
what WDT
made VBD
the AT
Morton NP-TL
Foods NNS-TL
stock NN
issue VB
such ABL
a AT
hot JJ
one CD
? .
? .

The AT
answer NN
is BEZ
that CS
it PPS
was BEDZ
a AT
combination NN
of IN
circumstances NNS
. .

First RB
, ,
the AT
general JJ
stock NN
market NN
has HVZ
been BEN
boiling VBG
upward RB
for IN
the AT
last AP
few AP
months NNS
, ,
driving VBG
stocks NNS
of IN
all ABN
kinds NNS
up RP

As CS
a AT
result NN
, ,
it PPS
is BEZ
not *
easy JJ
to TO
find VB
a AT
stock NN
priced VBN
as CS
the AT
Morton NP

was BEDZ
priced VBN
( (
at IN
roughly RB
10 CD

earnings NNS
, ,

yield VB
a AT
little AP
over IN
5 CD
per IN
cent NN
on IN
the AT
64-cent JJ
anticipated VBN
dividend NN
) )
. .

Second RB
, ,
the AT
`` ``
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
'' ''
has HVZ
caught VBN
the AT
fancy NN
of IN
investors NNS
lately RB
, ,
and CC
until CS
Morton NP-TL
Foods NNS-TL
came VBD
along RB
there EX
were BED
only AP
two CD
potato NN
chip NN

-- --
Frito NP

Both ABX
of IN
those DTS
have HV
had HVN
dynamic JJ
run-ups NNS
in IN
price NN
on IN
the AT

in IN
recent JJ
months NNS
, ,
both ABX
were BED
selling VBG
at IN
higher JJR
price-earnings NNS
and CC
yield NN
bases NNS
than CS
Morton NP
was BEDZ
coming VBG
to IN

at IN
, ,
and CC
everyone PN
who WPS
knew VBD
anything PN
about IN
it PPO
expected VBD
the AT
Morton NP
stock NN
to TO
have HV
a AT
fast JJ
run-up NN
. .

And CC
third RB
, ,
the AT
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
has HVZ
taken VBN
on RP
the AT
flavor NN
of IN
a AT
`` ``
growth NN
'' ''
industry NN
in IN
the AT
public JJ
mind NN
of IN
late JJ

Foods NNS
, ,
which WDT
long RB
had HVD
been BEN
considered VBN
`` ``

'' ''
but CC
hardly RB
dynamic JJ
stocks NNS
, ,
have HV
been BEN
acting VBG
like CS
growth NN
stocks NNS
, ,
going VBG
to IN
higher JJR
price-earnings NNS
ratios NNS

The AT
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
these DTS
days NNS
is BEZ
growing VBG
, ,
not *
only RB
as CS
a AT
result NN
of IN
population NN

and CC
public JJ
acceptance NN

, ,
but CC
also RB
because RB
of IN
a AT
combination NN
of IN
circumstances NNS
that WPS

led VBN
to IN
growth NN
by IN
merger NN
. .

The AT
history NN
of IN
the AT
U.S. NP
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
is BEZ
that CS
many AP
of IN
today's NR$
successful JJ
companies NNS
got VBD
started VBN
during IN
the AT
deep JJ
depression NN
days NNS
. .

Those DTS
that WPS

are BER
those DTS
that WPS

headed VBN
by IN
strong JJ
executives NNS

men NNS
with IN
the AT
abilities NNS
to TO
last VB
almost RB
30 CD
years NNS
in IN
the AT
competitive JJ
survival NN
of IN
the AT

But CC
today NR
many AP
of IN
those DTS
men NNS
are BER
reaching VBG
retirement NN
age NN
and CC
suddenly RB
realizing VBG
that CS
they PPSS
face VB
an AT

tax NN
problem NN
with IN
their PP$
closely RB
held VBN
companies NNS
and CC
also RB
that CS
they PPSS
have HV
no AT
second-echelon NN
management NN
in IN
their PP$

So CS
they PPSS
go VB
looking VBG
for IN
mergers NNS
with IN
other AP
firms NNS
that WPS
have HV
publicly RB
quoted VBN
stock NN
, ,
and CC
almost RB
daily RB
they PPSS
pound VB

What WDT
most AP
people NNS

if CS
they PPSS

tied VBN
up RP

the AT
thing NN
as CS
I PPSS
am BEM
, ,
is BEZ
that CS
90% NN
of IN
the AT

transportation NN

I PPSS
never RB
dreamed VBD

the AT
logistical JJ
difficulties NNS
involved VBN
until CS
, ,
at IN

last AP

both ABX

no AT

They PPSS
either CC

Now RB
they PPSS
go VB
to IN

that WPS

One PN
might MD

the AT

be BE
similar JJ

They PPSS
could MD
walk VB

It's PPS+BEZ
much QL
more QL
complex JJ

Generally RB

they PPSS

Gloriana NP

who WPS

down IN

This DT
is BEZ
a AT
way NN

getting VBG

, ,
but CC
, ,
I PPSS
understand VB
, ,
it PPS
entails VBZ
a AT
certain JJ
loss NN
of IN
social JJ
status NN

A AT
young JJ
man NN
doesn't DOZ*
like VB

be BE
driven VBN

`` ``
Why WRB

'' ''
? .

I PPSS
suggested VBD

`` ``
My PP$

`` ``

I PPSS

`` ``
No RB

I PPSS
said VBD
, ,
`` ``
I PPSS
didn't DOD*
happen VB
to TO
grow VB
up RP
in IN

'' ''

I PPSS
explained VBD

however WRB
, ,
that CS
I PPSS
had HVD
my PP$
share NN
of IN
hardship NN
in IN
making VBG
my PP$
daily JJ
pilgrimage NN
to IN
the AT
feet NNS
of IN
wisdom NN

I PPSS
had HVD
to TO
ride VB
a AT
streetcar NN
two CD

Sometimes RB
the AT
streetcar NN
was BEDZ
late RB
. .

Sometimes RB
there EX
weren't BED*
even RB
any DTI
seats NNS

I PPSS
had HVD
to TO
stand VB
up RP

with IN
the AT

Sometimes RB
I PPSS
got VBD
on IN
the AT
wrong JJ
car NN
and CC
didn't DOD*
get VB
to IN
school NN
at IN
all ABN
, ,
but CC
wound VBD
up RP
at IN
the AT
ocean NN
, ,
or CC
some DTI
other AP
dismal JJ
place NN
, ,
and CC
had HVD
to TO
spend VB
the AT
day NN
there RB
. .

I've PPSS+HV
tried VBN
to TO
compromise VB
by IN
letting VBG
them PPO
take VB
the AT
little JJ
car NN
now RB
and CC
then RB
. .

When WRB
they PPSS
do DO
that DT
my PP$
wife NN
has HVZ
to TO
drive VB
me PPO
to IN
work NN
in IN
the AT
big JJ
car NN

She PPS
has HVZ
to TO
have HV
at IN
least AP
one CD
car NN
herself PPL

I PPSS
feel VB
a AT
certain JJ
loss NN
of IN
status NN
when WRB
I PPSS
am BEM
driven VBN
up RP
in IN

of IN
work NN
in IN
a AT
car NN
driven VBN
by IN
my PP$
wife NN
, ,
who WPS
is BEZ
only RB
a AT
woman NN
. .

Even RB
that DT
isn't BEZ*
satisfactory JJ
. .

If CS
they PPSS
have HV
to TO
take VB
any DTI
car NN
, ,
they'd PPSS+MD
rather RB
take VB
the AT
big JJ
one CD
. .

They PPSS
say VB
that CS
when WRB
they PPSS
take VB
a AT
car NN
, ,
Gloriana NP
doesn't DOZ*
take VB
her PP$
car NN
, ,
but CC
rides VBZ
with IN
them PPO
. .

But CC
when WRB
Gloriana NP
rides VBZ
with IN
them PPO
they PPSS
also RB
have HV
to TO
take VB
the AT
two CD
girls NNS
who WPS
usually RB
ride VB
with IN
her PPO
, ,
so CS
the AT
little JJ
car NN
isn't BEZ*
big JJ
enough QLP
. .

The AT
logic NN
of IN
that DT
is BEZ
impeccable JJ
, ,
of IN
course NN
, ,
except IN
that CS
I PPSS
feel VB
like CS
a AT
fool NN
being BEG
driven VBN
up RP

work NN
in IN
a AT
little JJ
car NN
, ,
by IN
my PP$

when WRB
everybody PN
knows VBZ
I PPSS
have HV
a AT
big JJ
car NN
and CC
am BEM
capable JJ
of IN
driving VBG
myself PPL
. .

The AT
solution NN
, ,
naturally RB
, ,
is BEZ
the AT

However WRB
, ,
it's PPS+BEZ
a AT
half-mile NN
walk NN

The AT

The AT

a AT

67-year-old JJ

with IN
a AT

capacity NN

little AP
experience NN
in IN

The AT
announcement NN
last AP

forthcoming JJ
encounter NN
produced VBD
strong JJ
reactions NNS
in IN
the AT
U. NP
S. NP
of IN
both ABX
approval NN
and CC
disapproval NN

The AT
approval NN
did DOD
not *
arise VB
from IN
an AT
expectation NN
of IN
far-reaching JJ
agreements NNS
at IN
Vienna NP

The AT
inclination NN
was BEDZ
to TO
accept VB
the AT
statement NN
that CS
there EX
would MD
be BE
no AT
formal JJ
negotiations NNS

But CC
those DTS
who WPS
were BED
in IN
favor NN
of IN
the AT

felt VBD
that CS
a AT
frank JJ

between IN
the AT
two CD
men NNS
and CC
an AT
opportunity NN
to TO
size VB
one CD
another DT
up RP

prove VB
salutary JJ

Mr. NP
Khrushchev NP

on IN
his PP$

and CC
to TO
be BE
a AT
shrewd JJ

The AT
feeling NN

that CS

an AT
inner JJ
core NN

in IN
the AT
President NN-TL

that CS

Mr. NP

Apart RB
from IN
the AT
personal JJ
equation NN

another DT
reason NN
advanced VBN
in IN
favor NN
of IN
the AT

was BEDZ
that CS
too QL
often RB
in IN
the AT
past NN
the AT
U.S. NP
appeared VBD

dragged VBN
reluctantly RB

Premier NN-TL

capital NN
out IN

This DT
time NN
the AT

came VBD

in IN
part NN
at IN

from IN
Washington NP

Other AP-HL
allies NNS-HL

There EX
was BEDZ
also RB
the AT
fact NN
that CS

Mr. NP

the AT
President NN-TL
will MD
have HV
completed VBN
conversations NNS

the AT

principal JJS

Thus RB
he PPS

position NN

he PPS

Finally RB
, ,
there EX

a AT
wide JJ
area NN

President's NN$-TL
making VBG
a AT
final JJ
effort NN
in IN
the AT

There EX
is BEZ
no AT
single AP
issue NN
that WPS

aroused VBN
stronger JJR
feelings NNS
throughout IN
the AT
world NN
. .

If CS
tests NNS

to TO

resumed VBN
, ,
the AT
argument NN
went VBD
, ,
it PPS
is BEZ
vital JJ
that CS
the AT
U. NP
S. NP
make VB
plain JJ
that CS
the AT
onus NN
belongs VBZ
to IN
the AT
Soviet NN-TL
Union NN-TL
. .

Disapproval NN
of IN
the AT
meeting NN
was BEDZ
based VBN
largely RB
on IN
the AT
belief NN
that CS
the AT
timing NN
could MD
hardly RB
be BE
worse JJR
. .

After IN
Cuba NP
and CC
Laos NP
, ,
it PPS
was BEDZ
argued VBN
, ,
Mr. NP
Khrushchev NP
will MD
interpret VB
the AT
President's NN$-TL
consent NN
to IN
the AT
meeting NN
as CS
further JJR
evidence NN
of IN
Western JJ-TL
weakness NN
-- --
perhaps RB
even RB
panic NN

and CC
is BEZ
certain JJ
to TO
try VB
to TO
exploit VB
the AT
advantage NN
he PPS
now RB
believes VBZ
he PPS
holds VBZ
. .

Moreover RB
, ,
the AT
President NN-TL
is BEZ
meeting VBG
the AT
Soviet NN-TL
leader NN
at IN
a AT
time NN
when WRB
the AT
Administration NN-TL
has HVZ
still RB
not *
decided VBN
on IN
the AT
scope NN
of IN
America's NP$
firm JJ
foreign JJ
policy NN

The AT
question NN
was BEDZ
raised VBN
, ,
for IN

, ,
as IN
to IN
what WDT
attitude NN
the AT
President NN-TL
would MD
take VB
if CS
Mr. NP

a AT
broad JJ
neutral JJ
belt NN
extending VBG

Southeast JJ-TL
Asia NP-TL

Middle JJ-TL
East NR-TL

There EX

so CS
my PP$

mechanisms NNS

defense NN
that WPS

just QL
too QL

The AT

the AT
strain NN
so QL
well RB
at IN
a AT
relatively QL
early JJ
stage NN
in IN
the AT
evolutionary JJ

Though CS

not *
be BE
good JJ
biology NN

it PPS

aptly RB

the AT
strength NN

There EX

no AT

our PP$

The AT
deeper JJR
wonder NN

how WRB
this DT

accomplished VBN
in IN
decades NNS

rather IN

in IN

by IN

at IN

By IN
way NN
of IN
explanation NN
we PPSS
ourselves PPLS
are BER
prone JJ
to TO
imagine VB
that CS
this DT

stems VBZ
from IN
the AT

American JJ
Catholic JJ
zeal NN

which WDT

There EX

however WRB

one CD
curious JJ

Viewing VBG

we PPSS

But CC
the AT
simple JJ

that CS

certainly RB

but CC
the AT
down-to-earth JJ
test NN
is BEZ
the AT
allocation NN

diocesan JJ

American JJ
Catholics NPS

to IN
bishops' NNS$

appeals NNS

necessary JJ

Diocesan JJ

Yet RB
for IN

, ,
the AT
truth NN

is BEZ
that CS
most AP
American JJ

The AT

Second OD

The AT

it PPS

The AT

Perhaps RB
the AT
most QL

It PPS

This DT

a AT

They PPSS

All QL

There EX

many AP

One CD
of IN
the AT
most QL

economic JJ

Business NN
leaders NNS

They PPSS

putting VBG
strong JJ

In IN

these DTS

And CC

a AT
real JJ
sense NN

other AP
Southern JJ-TL
whites NNS

They PPSS

rather IN

they PPSS

Since CS

mostly RB

it PPS

this DT
: :

A AT

in IN
Lane NN-TL
A NP-TL

The AT

three CD

( (

slow VB

or CC
( (

alternately RB
accelerate VB

decelerate VB

thus RB
keeping VBG
the AT

thereby RB
making VBG
a AT
fascinating JJ
sport NN
of IN
the AT
whole JJ

The AT
really QL
remarkable JJ
thing NN
to IN
me PPO
is BEZ
that CS
most AP
California NP

unhesitatingly RB
elect VB

slow VB

Whether CS

this DT

But CC
it PPS

consistently RB

both ABX

This DT

There RB
such JJ
soggy JJ
acquiesence NN
would MD
be BE
looked VBN
upon RB
as CS
a AT
sure JJ
sign NN
of IN

In IN

the AT

likely RB
jam VB
his PP$
gas NN

in IN

This DT

however WRB

an AT

Many AP

seem VB
to TO
be BE
coldly RB
impractical JJ

out-of-step JJ

I PPSS
believe VB

priority NN

disabled VBN

But CC
I PPSS
don't DO*
believe VB
we PPSS

close VB
the AT

non-service-connected JJ
patients NNS

This DT

is BEZ
of IN
great JJ

and CC
the AT

may MD
mean VB
the AT
difference NN
between IN
life NN
or CC

, ,
or CC
at IN

serious JJ
injuries NNS
, ,
for IN
many AP

Some DTI
critics NNS
say VB
that CS
the AT
length NN
of IN
stay NN
in IN
a AT
hospital NN
is BEZ
too QL
long JJ
. .

There's EX+BEZ
a AT
reason NN
for IN
this DT
length NN
of IN
stay NN
. .

First OD
of IN
all ABN
, ,
the AT
admitting VBG
physician NN
in IN
the AT
VA NN
hospital NN
gets VBZ
the AT
patient NN
as CS
a AT
new JJ
patient NN
. .

He PPS
has HVZ
no AT
experience NN
with IN
this DT
veteran's NN$
previous JJ
medical JJ
record NN
. .

If CS
the AT
doctor NN
is BEZ
conscientious JJ
, ,
he PPS
wants VBZ
to TO
study VB
the AT
patient NN
. .

As CS
a AT
result NN
, ,
it PPS
takes VBZ
a AT
little QL
longer RBR
than CS
it PPS
would MD
on IN
the AT
outside NN
where WRB
the AT
family NN
physician NN
knows VBZ
about IN
the AT
patient NN
. .

Secondly RB
, ,
the AT
VA NN
physician NN
knows VBZ
that CS
when WRB
the AT
patient NN
leaves VBZ
the AT
hospital NN
, ,
he PPS
is BEZ
no QL
longer RBR
going VBG
to TO
have HV
a AT
chance NN
to TO
visit VB
his PP$
patient NN
. .

So CS
he PPS
keeps VBZ
the AT
veteran NN
in RP
until CS
he PPS
can MD
observe VB
the AT
effects NNS
of IN
treatment NN
or CC
surgery NN
. .

The AT
American JJ
public NN
must MD
be BE
presented VBN
with IN
the AT
facts NNS
concerning IN
VA NN
hospitalization NN
. .

The AT
public NN
should MD
understand VB
that CS
whether CS
they PPSS
support VB
a AT
state NN
hospital NN
or CC
a AT
VA NN
hospital NN
, ,
the AT
tax NN
dollar NN
has HVZ
to TO
be BE
paid VBN
one CD
way NN
or CC
the AT
other AP
. .

The AT
responsibility NN
is BEZ
still RB
going VBG
to TO
be BE
there RB
whether CS
they PPSS
pay VB
for IN
a AT
VA NN
hospital NN
or CC
the AT

An AT

It PPS

Escalation NN-HL

The AT

already RB

except IN
that CS
the AT

not *
being BEG
dropped VBN

-- --
not *

It PPS
is BEZ
being BEG

, ,
moreover RB
, ,
in IN
fairly QL
close JJ
correspondence NN
with IN
the AT
predictions NNS
of IN

They PPSS
predicted VBD
escalation NN

and CC
escalation NN
is BEZ
what WDT
we PPSS

getting VBG

The AT
biggest JJT
nuclear JJ
device NN
the AT
United VBN-TL

has HVZ
exploded VBN
measured VBD
some DTI
15 CD
megatons NNS

although CS
our PP$
B-52s NN
are BER
said VBN
to TO
be BE
carrying VBG
two CD
20-megaton NN
bombs NNS
apiece RB
. .

Some DTI
time NN
ago RB
, ,
however WRB
, ,
Mr. NP
Khrushchev NP
decided VBD
that CS
when WRB
bigger JJR
bombs NNS
were BED
made VBN
, ,
the AT
Soviet NN-TL
Union NN-TL
would MD
make VB
them PPO

He PPS
seems VBZ
to TO
have HV
at IN
least AP
a AT
few AP
30- CD
and CC
50-megaton JJ
bombs NNS
on IN
hand NN
, ,
since CS
we PPSS
cannot MD*
assume VB
that CS
he PPS
has HVZ
exploded VBN
his PP$
entire JJ
stock NN

And CC
now RB
, ,
of IN
course NN
, ,
the AT
hue NN
and CC
cry NN
for IN
counter-escalation NN
is BEZ
being BEG
raised VBN
on IN
our PP$

Khrushchev NP
threatens VBZ
us PPO
with IN
a AT
100-megaton JJ
bomb NN
? .
? .

So RB
be BE
it PPS
-- --
then RB
we PPSS
must MD
embark VB
on IN
a AT
crash JJ
program NN
for IN
200-megaton JJ
bombs NNS
of IN
the AT
common JJ
or CC
hydrogen NN
variety NN
, ,
and CC
neutron NN
bombs NNS
, ,
which WDT
do DO
not *
exist VB
but CC
are BER
said VBN
to TO
be BE
the AT
coming VBG
thing NN
. .

So RB
escalation NN
proceeds VBZ
, ,
ad FW-IN
infinitum FW-NN
or CC
, ,
more QL
accurately RB
, ,
until CS
the AT
contestants NNS
begin VB
dropping VBG

What WDT

Philip NP

in IN
The AT-TL
Cornell NP-TL

The AT

`` ``

When WRB

obvious JJ

during IN

the AT

The AT

Leaving VBG

The AT

made VBN
two CD
mistakes NNS

which WDT

The AT
first OD

the AT

which WDT

agricultural JJ

The AT

and CC
where WRB
it PPS

it PPS

and CC
the AT
social JJ

enormous JJ

For CS
it PPS

the AT
family NN
that WPS

Now RB
the AT

the AT

left VBN

granary NN

under IN

agricultural JJ

it PPS

Thus RB
the AT

the AT
vast JJ

which WDT

calamitous JJ

The AT
second OD
mistake NN
is BEZ
Tibet NP

Tibet NP

historically RB

China NP

A AT
friendly JJ

sometimes RB
only RB

China NP
never RB

Tibet NP

the AT

Red JJ-TL
China NP

Tibet NP

Tibet NP

These DTS

The AT

The AT
current JJ
stereotype NN
of IN
straight JJ
news NN
reporting NN
was BEDZ
probably RB
invaluable JJ
in IN
protecting VBG
the AT
press NN
and CC
its PP$
readers NNS
from IN
pollution NN
by IN
that DT
combination NN
of IN
doctored VBN
fact NN
, ,
fancy NN
, ,
and CC
personal JJ
opinion NN
called VBN
yellow JJ
journalism NN
which WDT
flourished VBD
in IN
this DT
country NN
more AP
than IN
a AT
generation NN
ago RB
. .

We PPSS
don't DO*
need VB
this DT
type NN
of IN
protection NN
any DTI
more AP
. .

The AT
public NN
is BEZ
now RB
armed VBN
with IN
sophistication NN
and CC
numerous JJ
competing VBG
media NNS
. .

Besides RB
, ,
there EX
are BER
no QL
longer RBR
enough AP
corruptible JJ
journalists NNS
about RB
. .

The AT
accepted VBN
method NN
of IN
writing VBG
news NN
has HVZ
two CD
major JJ
liabilities NNS
. .

First RB
, ,
it PPS
does DOZ
not *
communicate VB
. .

A AT
reporter NN
restricted VBN
to IN
the AT
competing VBG
propaganda NN
statements NNS
of IN
both ABX
sides NNS
in IN
a AT
major JJ
labor NN
dispute NN
, ,
for IN
instance NN
, ,
is BEZ
unable JJ
to TO
tell VB
his PP$
readers NNS
half ABN
of IN
what WDT
he PPS
knows VBZ
about IN
the AT
causes NNS
of IN
the AT
dispute NN
. .

Second RB
, ,
it PPS
subjects VBZ
the AT
news NN
to IN
distortion NN
by IN
the AT
unscrupulous JJ
. .

The AT
charges NNS
by IN
the AT
late JJ
junior JJ
Senator NN-TL
from IN
Wisconsin NP
not *
only RB
destroyed VBD
innocent JJ
people NNS
but CC
misled VBD
the AT
nation NN
. .

Yet RB
the AT
press NN
was BEDZ
powerless JJ
to TO
put VB
these DTS
charges NNS
in IN
perspective NN
in IN
its PP$
news NN
columns NNS
. .

Despite IN
several AP
years NNS
of IN
front-page NN
stories NNS
, ,
the AT
average NN
citizen NN
was BEDZ
unable JJ
to TO
get VB
a AT
complete JJ
picture NN
of IN
McCarthy NP
until CS
he PPS
saw VBD
on IN
the AT
television NN
screen NN
what WDT
the AT
reporters NNS
had HVD
been BEN
seeing VBG
all QL
along RB
but CC
had HVD
no AT
effective JJ
way NN
of IN
communicating VBG
. .

The AT
Senator NN-TL
had HVD
boxed VBN
them PPO
in RP
with IN
their PP$
own JJ
restrictions NNS
. .

It PPS
seems VBZ
to IN
me PPO
the AT
time NN
has HVZ
come VBN
for CS
the AT
American JJ
press NN
to TO
start VB
experimenting VBG
with IN
ways NNS
of IN
reporting VBG
the AT
news NN
that WPS
will MD
do DO
a AT
better JJR
job NN

and CC
will MD
be BE
less AP
subject NN
to IN

by IN
those DTS
who WPS
have HV
learned VBN
how WRB
to TO
manipulate VB
the AT
present JJ
stereotype NN
to TO
serve VB
their PP$
own JJ
ends NNS
. .

The AT
objective NN
should MD
be BE
to TO
provide VB
a AT
method NN
of IN
getting VBG
into IN
print NN
a AT
higher JJR
percentage NN
than CS

now RB
possible JJ

I PPSS

Next RB

Up RP

the AT

Even RB

However RB

This DT

The AT

I PPSS

However RB

For IN-HL

? .
? .

( (
SR NN
, ,
Feb. NP

) )
. .

In IN
my PP$
estimation NN
, ,
we PPSS
definitely RB
do DO
; .
; .

and CC
the AT
sad JJ
part NN
of IN
it PPO
is BEZ
that CS
we PPSS
had HVD
one CD
, ,
which WDT
was BEDZ
rounding VBG
into IN
excellent JJ
shape NN
, ,
and CC
we PPSS
let VB
it PPO
disintegrate VB
and CC
die VB
. .

During IN
the AT
war NN
, ,
we PPSS
set VBD
up RP
schools NNS
for IN
the AT
teaching NN
of IN
psychological JJ
warfare NN
, ,
which WDT
included VBD
the AT
teaching NN
of IN
propaganda NN
, ,
both ABX
black JJ
and CC
white JJ
and CC
the AT
various JJ
shades NNS
of IN
grey JJ
in IN

We PPSS
had HVD
a AT
couple NN
of IN
schools NNS
in IN
this DT
country NN
, ,
the AT
principal JJS
one CD
being BEG
on IN
the AT
Marshall NP

There EX
were BED
also RB
a AT

several AP

The AT
English JJ
schools NNS
preceded VBD
ours PP$$
, ,
and CC
by IN
the AT
time NN
we PPSS
got VBD
into IN
it PPO
they PPSS
had HVD
learned VBN
a AT
lot NN
about IN
the AT
techniques NNS
of IN

and CC
its PP$

. .

Four CD
of IN
us PPO
here RB
in IN
the AT
United VBN-TL

attended VBD

first RB
as CS

then RB
as CS

almost RB
every AT
one CD
of IN
these DTS
schools NNS
, ,
in IN
England NP
, ,
Canada NP
, ,
and CC
the AT
United VBN-TL
States NNS-TL
. .

We PPSS
set VBD
up RP
the AT
Lloyd's NP$-TL
Neck NN-TL
school NN
, ,
worked VBD
out RP
its PP$
curriculum NN
, ,
and CC
taught VBD
there RB
. .

Toward IN
the AT
end NN
of IN
the AT
war NN
, ,
we PPSS
really RB
felt VBD
that CS
we PPSS
had HVD
learned VBN
something PN
about IN
propaganda NN
and CC
how WRB
to TO
teach VB
it PPO
. .

When WRB
the AT
end NN
did DOD
come VB
, ,
and CC
the AT
schools NNS
were BED
disbanded VBN
and CC
abandoned VBN
, ,
we PPSS
felt VBD
and CC
hoped VBD
that CS
the AT
machinery NN
of IN
psychological JJ
warfare NN
would MD
not *
be BE
allowed VBN

rust VB

We PPSS
hoped VBD
that CS

practitioners NNS

might MD
be BE
put VBN
on IN
some DTI
sort NN
of IN
reserve NN
list NN
and CC
called VBN
back RB
for IN
refresher NN
courses NNS
each DT

or CC
so RB
. .

Alas UH
, ,
no AT
such JJ
thing NN
happened VBD

There EX
apparently RB
is BEZ
no AT
school NN
of IN
propaganda NN
or CC
psychological JJ

. .

A AT
study NN
at IN
the AT
Pentagon NN-TL
and CC
at IN
the AT
service NN
academies NNS
revealed VBD
that CS
nothing PN
was BEDZ
being BEG
done VBN
there RB

And CC
not *
one CD

About RB
that DT

John NP

NBC NP

it PPS

For IN

there EX

the AT

However WQL
well RB
chosen VBN

cleverly RB

such JJ

to IN
more AP

Another DT

this DT

that CS

Similarly RB

in IN

the AT

`` ``

By IN

Her PP$

To IN

All ABN

In IN

there EX

perhaps RB
symbolic JJ

no AT

Several AP

some DTI

what WDT

far QL
more QL

most AP
of IN

generated VBN

But CC
what WDT

equally RB

the AT

lyric NN

both ABX
the AT

Mulligan's NP$

thus RB

the AT

possibly RB
in IN
an AT
effort NN

the AT

A AT

an AT

The AT

`` ``

was BEDZ
interpreted VBN
according IN

a AT
principle NN
that WPS

becoming VBG
increasingly QL
common JJ
in IN
the AT

comedy NN
-- --
the AT
idea NN
of IN
turning VBG
some DTI
obviously RB
ludicrous JJ
figure NN
into IN
a AT

Among IN
the AT
Moliere NP
specialists NNS
of IN
some DTI

, ,
Louis NP
Jouvet NP
tried VBD

humanize VB
some DTI

while CS

made VBD
them PPO
more QL
gross JJ

Apparently RB

Jouvet NP

Ledoux NP
attempted VBD
just RB
these DTS
dissimilar JJ

in IN
the AT
role NN
of IN
Arnolphe NP
in IN
`` ``

I PPSS

`` ``

although CS

Jouvet NP

Arnolphe NP

by IN

dropped VBN
the AT

Arnolphe NP

it PPS

who WPS

The AT

one CD
influential JJ
French JJ
critic NN
remarked VBD
: :
`` ``

Accordingly RB
, ,
at IN
the AT
Comedie FW-NN-TL
last AP

Jean NP
Meyer NP
played VBD
a AT
sympathetic JJ
Arnolphe NP

criticism NN
for IN

the AT

But CC
the AT

not *
truly RB

the AT

Wisely RB

the AT

Tartuffe NP

so RB
the AT

Louis NP

the AT

His PP$

But CC
his PP$

out IN

Occasionally RB

In IN

Dr. NN-TL
Bonnor NP
begins VBZ

a AT

of IN
the AT
relativistic JJ
theories NNS
of IN
the AT

based VBN

First OD

this DT

that DT

the AT

Because RB

this DT
Dr. NN-TL

Expands VBZ-HL

Dr. NN-TL
Bonnor NP
supports VBZ
the AT
idea NN
that CS
the AT
universe NN
both ABX
expands VBZ
and CC
contracts VBZ
, ,
that CS
in IN
several AP

the AT

will MD
slow VB

and CC
that CS
the AT

Then RB
, ,
after IN
many QL

billions NNS

when WRB
all ABN
the AT

whistling VBG

common JJ

this DT

will MD
slow VB

and CC

. .

Professor NN-TL
Bondi NP
disagrees VBZ
with IN
the AT
expansion-contraction NN
theory NN

He PPS
supports VBZ
the AT
steady-state NN
theory NN
which WDT
holds VBZ
that CS
matter NN
is BEZ
continually RB
being BEG
created VBN
in IN
space NN
. .

For IN
this DT
reason NN
, ,
he PPS
says VBZ
, ,
the AT
density NN
of IN
the AT
universe NN
always RB
remains VBZ
the AT
same AP
even RB
though CS
the AT
galaxies NNS

New JJ

forever RB

the AT
gaps NNS

If CS
this DT

true JJ

then RB
the AT

just RB

millions NNS

even RB

For CS

Professor NN-TL
Bondi NP

it PPS

only RB

necessary JJ

He PPS
contends VBZ
this DT
idea NN
doesn't DOZ*
conflict VB
with IN
experiments NNS
on IN
which WDT
the AT
principle NN

because CS

Dr. NN-TL
Lyttleton NP
backs VBZ
the AT
theory NN
that CS
we PPSS
live VB
in IN
an AT
electric JJ
universe NN
and CC
this DT
theory NN
starts VBZ
with IN
the AT
behavior NN
of IN
protons NNS

electrons NNS

Protons NNS
and CC
electrons NNS
bear VB
opposite JJ
electrical JJ
charges NNS
which WDT
make VB
them PPO
attract VB
each DT

, ,
and CC
when WRB
they PPSS

they PPSS
make VB
up RP
an AT
atom NN
of IN
hydrogen NN
-- --
the AT
basic JJ
building VBG
block NN

The AT
charges NNS
of IN
the AT
electron NN
and CC
proton NN
are BER
believed VBN
to TO
be BE
exactly QL
equal JJ
and CC
opposite JJ
, ,
but CC
Dr. NN-TL
Lyttleton NP
is BEZ
not *
so QL
sure JJ

Suppose VB
, ,
says VBZ
Dr. NN-TL
Lyttleton NP
, ,
the AT
proton NN
has HVZ
a AT
slightly QL
greater JJR
charge NN
than CS
the AT
electron NN
( (
so QL
slight JJ
it PPS

presently RB
immeasurable JJ
) )
. .

This DT
would MD
give VB
the AT
hydrogen NN
atom NN
a AT
slight JJ
charge-excess NN

Now RB
if CS
one CD
hydrogen NN
atom NN
were BED
placed VBN
at IN
the AT
surface NN

it PPS

both ABX

gravitation NN
of IN
the AT

and CC
the AT
charge-excess NN
of IN
all ABN
those DTS
atoms NNS
in IN
the AT

Because CS
electrical JJ
forces NNS
( (
the AT
charge-excess NN
) )
are BER
far QL
more QL
powerful JJ
than CS
gravitation NN
, ,
the AT
surface NN
hydrogen NN
atoms NNS
would MD
shoot VB
away RB

Dr. NN-TL
Lyttleton NP
then RB
imagines VBZ
the AT

as CS
a AT

In IN

we PPSS

this DT

We PPSS

first RB

that CS

an AT
alternative NN
other AP

the AT
three CD
typically RB

Bultmann NP

To TO
do DO
this DT

it PPS
is BEZ
sufficient JJ
to TO
point VB
out RP
that CS
if CS
the AT
principle NN
in IN

conceived VBN

such JJ

two CD

then RB
the AT
question NN
of IN
a AT
`` ``

possibility NN
is BEZ
a AT
meaningless JJ
question NN

Thus RB
, ,
if CS
what WDT

at IN
issue NN
is BEZ
whether CS
`` ``
All ABN

it PPS

since CS
in IN
either DTX

the AT

false JJ

Hence RB
, ,
if CS
what WDT

in IN
question NN

whether CS

for CS

Therefore RB

the AT

pseudo JJ
position NN
( (

A AT

It PPS

that CS

The AT

Because CS

One CD

the AT

Irenaeus NP

Thus RB

Recent JJ

He PPS

This DT
emphasis NN

rather IN

fundamental JJ
problem NN
Irenaeus NP

many AP
early JJ

It PPS

These DTS

The AT

Such JJ

whether CS

If CS

One CD

The AT
embarrassment NN

these DTS

an AT
illustration NN

the AT
thesis NN
that DT

It PPS

the AT

If CS

inevitable JJ
that CS

the AT
state NN

This DT

If CS

more AP

sin NN
receives VBZ
less AP

the AT

Such ABL
an AT

for CS
it PPS

salvation NN

not *
salvation NN

In IN

liberalism NN

However RB
, ,
there EX
is BEZ
a AT
crucial JJ
difference NN
between IN

Emerson NP
evaded VBD
the AT

by IN
shoving VBG

aside RB
, ,

rather RB
by IN
leaving VBG
it PPO
behind IN
him PPO

he PPS
walked VBD
out IN

so CS
that CS

wound NN

preserve VB
its PP$
self-respect NN
and CC
eventually RB
accord VB
him PPO
pious JJ
veneration NN

Parker NP
insisted VBD
upon IN
not *
resigning VBG

even RB
when WRB
the AT

wanted VBD
him PPO
to TO
depart VB
, ,
upon IN
daring VBG
the AT
Fellowship NN-TL
to TO

out RP

Hence RB
he PPS
was BEDZ
in IN

as CS

a AT

He PPS

neither CC

Actually RB

the AT
dispute NN

Parker NP

both ABX
ecclesiastical JJ

a AT
real JJ

a AT

It PPS
cannot MD*
be BE
smoothed VBN

by IN
solemnly RB
calling VBG

a AT
reconsideration NN
of IN
the AT
justice NN
of IN
the AT
objections NNS
to IN
him PPO
. .

The AT
fact NN
is BEZ
incontestable JJ
: :
that DT
liberal JJ
world NN
of IN
Unitarian JJ
Boston NP
was BEDZ
narrow-minded JJ
, ,
intellectually RB
sterile JJ

smug JJ

afraid JJ
of IN
the AT
logical JJ
consequences NNS
of IN
its PP$

mild JJ
ventures NNS
into IN
iconoclasm NN
, ,
and CC
quite QL
prepared VBN
to TO
resort VB
to IN
hysterical JJ
repressions NNS
when WRB
its PP$
brittle JJ

were BED
threatened VBN

Parker NP

along RB

bravery NN
when WRB
facing VBG

Mexican JJ-TL

Nevertheless RB
, ,
we PPSS

find VB
reasons NNS
for IN

even RB
the AT

; .

their PP$

were BED
genuine JJ
, ,
and CC
the AT
division NN
between IN

is BEZ
clear-cut JJ

But CC
Parker NP
as CS
the AT

within IN
the AT
pale NN
of IN
a AT

which WDT

proclaimed VBN

not *

by IN
holding VBG

Even RB
though CS

the AT

at IN

And CC

I PPSS

it PPO
fair JJ

But CC
Theodore NP

perhaps RB

Now RB

if CS

To TO

Here RB

I PPSS

what WDT

Notice VB

a AT

First RB

`` ``
the AT

He PPS
lived VBD
in IN
a AT
very QL
dark JJ
world NN
, ,
but CC
he PPS

not *
in IN

The AT

God NP
who WPS

this DT

into IN

when WRB
He PPS

: :
`` ``

those DTS

His PP$
very QL

He PPS

the AT

-- --
this DT
God NP
still RB

which WDT

For IN
those DTS

He PPS

: :
`` ``

! .

And CC
there EX

In IN
fact NN
, ,
He PPS
came VBD
into IN
this DT

Himself PPL
, ,
in IN
the AT
person NN

His PP$
Son NN-TL

Jesus NP
Christ NP

who WPS
stood VBD
here RB
amid IN

`` ``

The AT

even RB

only RB
anticipate VB
the AT

He PPS

he PPS

We PPSS

of IN
that DT
great JJ

; .

for IN
us PPO
it PPS
is BEZ
a AT
fact NN
in IN

Why WRB
should MD
we PPSS
not *
have HV
the AT

faith NN

and CC
an AT
even QL
greater JJR
experience NN
of IN
the AT

which WDT
it PPS

? .
? .

This DT
is BEZ
the AT
faith NN
that WPS
moved VBD
the AT
psalmist NN
to TO
add VB
his PP$
second OD
conception NN
of IN
God NP
: :
`` ``
The AT
Lord NN-TL
is BEZ
my PP$
salvation NN
'' ''
. .

He PPS
knew VBD
that CS
his PP$
God NP
would MD
save VB
him PPO
from IN
his PP$
enemies NNS
because CS
He PPS
had HVD
saved VBN
him PPO
from IN

If CS
God NP
could MD
do DO
that DT
, ,
He PPS
could MD

The AT
enemies NNS

threatening VBG

, ,
were BED
nothing PN
compared VBN

the AT

his PP$

And CC
God NP
had HVD
conquered VBN
that DT
one CD

His PP$

! .

So RB
why WRB
worry VB
about IN
all ABN
the AT

? .
? .

The AT
apostle NN
Paul NP
said VBD
the AT

This DT
is BEZ
the AT
key NN
to IN
the AT
conquest NN
of IN

This DT
gets VBZ
down RP
to IN
the AT
heart NN
of IN
our PP$
problem NN
, ,
for CS
it PPS
reconciles VBZ
us PPO
with IN
God NP
, ,
whom WPO
we PPSS
fear VB
most AP
of IN
all ABN
because CS
we PPSS
have HV
sinned VBN
against IN
Him PPO
. .

When WRB
that DT
fear NN
has HVZ
been BEN
removed VBN
by IN
faith NN
in IN
Jesus NP
Christ NP
, ,
when WRB
we PPSS
know VB
that CS
He PPS

our PP$
Savior NN-TL
, ,
that CS
He PPS
has HVZ
paid VBN
our PP$
debt NN
with IN
His PP$
blood NN
, ,
that CS
He PPS
has HVZ
met VBN
the AT
demands NNS
of IN
God's NP$
justice NN
and CC
thus RB
has HVZ
turned VBN
His PP$
wrath NN
away RB
-- --
when WRB
we PPSS
know VB
that DT
, ,
we PPSS
have HV
peace NN
with IN
God NP
in IN
our PP$

; .
; .

and CC
then RB
, ,
with IN
this DT
God NP
on IN
our PP$
side NN
, ,
we PPSS
can MD
face VB
the AT
whole JJ
world NN
without IN
fear NN

And CC
so RB
the AT
psalmist NN
gives VBZ
us PPO
one CD
more AP
picture NN
of IN
God NP
: :
`` ``
The AT
Lord NN-TL
is BEZ
the AT
strength NN
of IN

'' ''
. .

The AT
word NN
is BEZ
really RB
`` ``

It PPS
recalls VBZ
those DTS
words NNS
of IN
another DT
psalm NN
: :
`` ``
God NP

our PP$
refuge NN
and CC
strength NN
, ,
a AT
very QL
present JJ

in IN

Therefore RB
will MD
not *
we PPSS
fear VB
, ,
though CS
the AT
earth NN
be BE
removed VBN

and CC
though CS
the AT
mountains NNS
be BE
carried VBN
into IN

of IN
the AT

Come VB

behold VB
the AT

of IN
the AT
Lord NN-TL
, ,
what WDT

He PPS
hath HVZ
made VBN
in IN

But CC
, ,
again RB
, ,
we PPSS
have HV
no AT
real JJ
evidence NN
on IN
this DT
from IN
that DT
quarter NN
until IN
the AT
close NN
of IN
the AT

when WRB

Thus RB

while CS

that CS

In IN
